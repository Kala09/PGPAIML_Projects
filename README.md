# PGPAIML_Projects
This repo consists of all the projects build in my PGPAIML course training.

This repository showcases a collection of hands-on projects where I applied theoretical concepts to real-world problems across Computer Vision, NLP, Neural Networks, and Advanced Machine Learning.

Each project focuses on end-to-end problem solving, including data analysis, model development, evaluation, and business or practical insights.

👩‍💻 About Me
